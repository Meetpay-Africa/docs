## Welcome

Welcome to the MeetPay Merchant Integration API documentation. This API allows merchants to integrate MeetPay into their systems to collect payments and disburse payouts.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using a Bearer Token (your API Key). You **must** include your API key in the `Authorization` header of each request, prefixed with `Bearer `.

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your_api_key>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Why am I getting a 401 in the documentation?**
> 1. **Wrong Server:** Ensure you have selected the correct environment (e.g., `http://localhost:8081`) from the server dropdown in the interactive playground. Your API key is environment-specific.
> 2. **Double Prefixing:** In the "Try It" feature, enter **only** your raw API key. Do not include the `Bearer ` prefix yourself, as the system adds it automatically.
> 3. **Direct Requests:** In your code, you **must** include the `Bearer ` prefix (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <key>`).

## Idempotency

Idempotency ensures that a specific operation is only performed once, even if you retry the request (e.g., due to a network timeout). This is mandatory for operations that create resources, such as creating a payment.

### API Key vs Idempotency Key

| Feature | API Key | Idempotency-Key |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Header Name** | `Authorization` | `Idempotency-Key` |
| **Purpose** | Authentication (Who you are) | Duplicate Prevention (Request uniqueness) |
| **Format** | `Bearer <key>` | Any unique string (UUID recommended) |
| **Lifespan** | Long-term (Permanent) | Single Request (Per Transaction) |
| **Required?** | Yes, for all private endpoints | Mandatory for `POST /api/v1/payments` |

### Auto-generating the Key

You should generate a new, unique key (usually a UUID) for every new payment you create. If you retry a request with the same `Idempotency-Key`, the API will return the existing transaction instead of creating a new one.

    ```php

<Tip>
  In **Postman**, you can use `{{$guid}}` in the header value to automatically generate a unique UUID for every request.
